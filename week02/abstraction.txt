W02 Assignment: Explain Abstraction

---> What is abstraction and why is it important?

-- Answer:

Abstraction is the principle of hiding complex implementation details while exposing only essential functionality. This makes code easier to manage, understand, and scale.

A key benefit of abstraction is modularityâ€”it allows different parts of a program to interact without knowing internal details. For example, in a shopping cart program, a Product class can encapsulate product details while exposing only necessary methods:

Coding Example:
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price, quantity):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity

    def get_total_price(self):
        return self.price * self.quantity

This allows the rest of the program to use get_total_price() without worrying about how it works, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

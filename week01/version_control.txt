W01 Assignment: Explain Version Control
Overview
Articulate the principle of version control.

Instructions
Now that you have learned about the principle of version control and practiced using Git and GitHub, answer the following question (the way you would in a job interview):

---> What is version control and why is it important?

Your response must:
- Explain the meaning of Version Control
- Highlight a benefit of Version Control
- Example of version control: Describe the way version control might be used on a software development team.
- Show a command used in Version Control (for example a Git command)
- Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)

Version control is a system that helps track and manage changes in a project, especially in software development. It allows multiple people to work on the same project without losing previous versions or overwriting each other's work.
One key benefit of version control is that it helps recover previous versions if a mistake is made. This makes it easier to fix errors and track progress. For example, in a software development team, each developer can work on a different feature and later combine their work without conflicts.
A common Git command is "git commit", which saves changes to the project so they can be reviewed or restored later.
In summary, version control is essential for teamwork, organization, and preventing data loss.
